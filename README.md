# tree-canopy

We forecast forest canopy change using a binary classification target:

**High Canopy Growth** â€“ The classification compares forest canopy change between 2015 and 2019 (a 4-year period), and counties with a â‰¥5% increase are labeled as high growth (1), others as 0.
**Stable/Declining** â€“ All other counties.

## Forest Canopy Change as Target

[**Our Forest Canopy Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/10i3CP3Tgoxxj7PTxvr6YGw9AaxoI4Kxu?usp=sharing) prepares forest canopy data for use in our [Run Models Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1zu0WcCiIJ5X3iN1Hd1KSW4dGn0JuodB8?usp=sharing). The dataset is retrieved using the [**DataCommons API**](https://datacommons.org/) and paired with county-level geographic information based on FIPS codes.

The Colab notebook generates a `.csv` file that classifies each U.S. county into two groups based on their **relative forest cover growth over the past 4 years**.

This dataset is based on **Copernicus-derived forest land cover** as a percentage, accessed through DataCommons for each U.S. county from the most recent available years (2015-2019).

## Processing Steps

**1. County Metadata Collection**:
   - Retrieved all counties in the U.S. using `get_places_in(["country/USA"], "County")`.
   - Extracted **county and state names** for each region.

**2. Forest Land Cover Data Retrieval**:
   - Queried DataCommons for the variable `LandCoverFraction_Forest`.
   - Fetched multi-year data (e.g., 2015â€“2019) per county.

**3. Determine Growth Window**:
   - Identified the **most recent year** of data.
   - Compared it to data from **years prior**.

**4. Merge and Clean Data**:
   - Cleaned FIPS codes and renamed columns for consistency.
   - Removed " County" suffix and standardized capitalization.

**5. Calculate Relative Growth**:
   - Computed:
     ```python
     relative_growth = ((recent - start) / start) * 100
     ```
   - A county with a **â‰¥5% increase** in forest cover is labeled as `1` (high growth), otherwise `0`.

**6. Export Final Target File**:
   - Saved to:
     ```
     input/targets/forest_canopy_data_target.csv
     ```
   - Columns:
     - `Fips`: U.S. county code
     - `Target`: Binary target

## How It Works

The `.csv` file is used as a **target input** for ML models predicting forest canopy trends based on other features (e.g., economic activity).

You can plug this into any modeling workflow by referencing the parameter YAML described below.

## ðŸ”Ž Workflow Overview (with the CSV)

1. **Target Formation**
   - Extract U.S. county metadata via FIPS codes.
   - Retrieve Copernicus-derived forest cover data.
   - Calculate relative growth:
     ```python
     relative_growth = ((recent - start) / start) * 100
     ```
   - Label counties as High Growth (1) or Stable/Declining (0).

2. **Mathematical Analysis**
   - Rank counties by canopy change.
   - Identify **top 10 counties per state** with largest decreases.

3. **Preprocessing for EDA**
   - Clean FIPS codes, merge metadata.
   - Drop unrelated features, handle missing values.
   - Reshape data into **long format** for time-series models.

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - **Linear Regression** (`sklearn`) for trend fitting.  
   - **ARIMA** (`statsmodels`) for 5-year canopy forecasts.  
   - Rolling-window validation used for robustness.

5. **Statewise Pipelines**
   - Group counties by state for **localized forecasting**.
   - Outputs structured for visualization.

6. **Interactive Dashboard (TODO)**
   - Planned UI with dropdown menus for **state + county selection**.
   - Direct access to forecasts from pipelines.
